# salt-at-home

Using Saltstack to my tools on my personal Ubuntu 20.04 machine.

```bash
# add the gpg key
wget -O - https://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/18.04/amd64/latest/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub | sudo apt-key add -
# add the repo
echo "deb http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/18.04/amd64/latest bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/saltstack.list

curl -o bootstrap-salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sudo sh bootstrap-salt.sh -P -x python3
```
